# Monthly Beatmapping Contest: October 2023

作者：**pishifat, Hivie, Kimitakari**

Rumors say that you're the world's #1 mapper. Now's your chance to prove it.

For those out of the loop, the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) is exactly what you'd expect: a mapping contest that runs each month... for different game modes.

This month's contest is open to **osu!taiko** and **osu!catch** mappers.

Next month will feature a new contest for **osu!** and **osu!mania**, along with the results for [September's contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023) (which is currently being judged)!

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

To keep things fresh, every MBC has a *limitation* that requires mappers to compete on an similar playing field!

#### osu!taiko

Given osu!taiko mapping is pretty limited to begin with, this contest is opting for a more song-oriented challenge: **your beatmap's song must be 240 BPM or faster.**

#### osu!catch

osu!catch is taking a much simpler approach: **your beatmap's star rating must be 5.00 stars or higher.**

Apparently the winners of some previous osu!catch contests have been *Rain* difficulties that competed against a bunch of *Overdose* difficulties, so this limitation aims to bring all submissions to an expert-oriented skill level.

### Songs

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest!

If you're mapping osu!taiko, ensure that your song is [**at least 240 BPM**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks?is_default_sort=true&sort=update_desc&bpm[gte]=240), as outlined in the [limitation above](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-10-10-monthly-beatmapping-contest-october-2023#limitation).

And of course, if you'd rather not map a long song, feel free to cut it to a shorter length!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point
- **Screening crew's #1 pick:** 1 point

These numbers may vary depending on how many submissions the contest receives. Check [the wiki article](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Contest_points) for details.

Contest points reward users at certain thresholds:

- **Profile badges** are attainable at 2, 4, and 6 points each. The badges are tiered, meaning each new badge will replace the previous one!
- ***Elite Mapper\* [user title](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/User_title)** is attainable at 6 points.

Additionally, a [**Mappers' Guild keychain**](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/images/shared/news/2023-08-29-changes-to-the-mappers-guild/keychain.jpg) is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

## Rules

If you're looking for a lawless contest, wait for the next [Aspire](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Aspire). In the meantime, pay attention:

- **Submissions must follow the month's beatmapping [limitation](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-10-10-monthly-beatmapping-contest-october-2023#limitation):**
  - **osu!taiko:** your beatmap's song must be 240 BPM or faster.
  - **osu!catch:** your beatmap's star rating must be 5.00 stars or higher.
- **Submissions must be a single difficulty from one of the month's [selected songs](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-10-10-monthly-beatmapping-contest-october-2023#songs).**
- **Submissions must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded to the osu! website until after the contest's results are finalised.**
- **Submissions must abide by the [ranking criteria](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_criteria).**
- **Your submission must be solely made by you.** Collaborations are not allowed for this contest!

Note that all submissions will be anonymised before they're reviewed by screeners/judges to avoid bias. During this process, storyboards and backgrounds may be removed, and for osu!taiko, elements that don't affect gameplay (such as object locations in the editor) will be standardised across all submissions.
