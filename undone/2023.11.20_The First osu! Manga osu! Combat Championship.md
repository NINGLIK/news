WhiteCat exudes an air of aloofness, often carrying a sense of tension, but beneath the surface lies intelligence and a careful choice of words. His determination and focus were forged through a tragic event in his youth when he lost his brother, BlackDog, in an incident involving mrekk. WhiteCat has harboured blame toward mrekk for his loss, yet he grapples with a moral dilemma: should he seek revenge, or aspire to become the greatest osu! player through fair means? At the age of 15, WhiteCat's uncontrollable power led to a berserk episode, with peppy being the only one capable of stopping him.

A true businessman, mrekk is willing to go to any lengths to secure profits and success. He seldom finds time or inclination for frivolous pursuits, such as relationships or family, as his primary focus is on strengthening his business. His unwavering desire for profit is rooted in a profound fear of poverty, stemming from a childhood trauma that has left a lasting impact.

On the surface, Umbre is a bit of a jokester, often cracking light-hearted quips at WhiteCat and creating a generally pleasant atmosphere. He serves as an exceptionally effective mentor, stepping into the role of WhiteCat's brother figure after the loss of BlackDog and helping to nurture him into the state he's in today. Umbre suffers an internal struggle, torn between being Umbre the player or Umbre the brother. Nonetheless, his kind-hearted nature prevails, leading him to make the decision to guide WhiteCat to heights he could never have imagined.

An extroverted and composed individual, xootynator exudes boundless optimism. Her quest for enjoyment is inseparable from her determination to make her mark in the predominantly male-dominated arena of combat. Fuelled by the excitement of battle and a commitment to shatter gender barriers, xootynator also finds immense joy in the world of art, with a particular fondness for birds.
