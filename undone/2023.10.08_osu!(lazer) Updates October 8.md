# osu!(lazer) Updates: October 8

作者：**Walavouchey**

The rules of the game are rapidly changing, with even more revisions in the making.

Considering these updates now come every two weeks instead of every month (in case you hadn't noticed), you're probably wondering how there are still so many changes to summarise. We wonder that ourselves, too.

View or read the summary below:

### Changes

- **Lower maximum required spinner RPM cap based on Overall Difficulty.** The maximum achievable bonus score (when "completing" a spinner) is now calculated based on a few reference RPM values, the fastest being 430 RPM at OD 10. This basically makes getting the maximum possible score on spinners easier for everyone.

| Value                   | OD 0 | OD 5 | OD 10 |
| :---------------------- | ---: | ---: | ----: |
| Clear RPM               |   90 |  150 |   225 |
| Completion RPM (stable) |  477 |  477 |   477 |
| Completion RPM (lazer)  |  250 |  380 |   430 |

- **Extended information on mod icons.** The Double Time and Half Time icons (as well as their pitch-changing variants) now directly show custom speed changes, making the mods easy to visually compare on leaderboards without needing to hover over their icons.
- **Design changes for the argon skin.** The health bar is redesigned (and will not be as wide as it is now by default in the future) and an outline was added to slider reverse arrows.
- **New restrictions on maximum skin sprite dimensions.** In order to prevent exploits, most gameplay skin sprites now can't be arbitrarily large. Maxumum values were chosen with the help of skinning expert [RockRoller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8388854) in order to accommodate as many existing skins as feasible.
- **Revised classic scoring formula, better matching osu!(stable) for all game modes.** Specifically, the rate of score growth has been adjusted. If you watch a replay side by side in both client versions (i.e. to compare ScoreV1 and classic scoring), the score will essentially match better now throughout the replay.

Minor performance improvements and various bug fixes are documented in incredibly minute detail in the [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.1008.0), as usual.

You probably want to open the game right now and... play the game. Go do that, unless you have a deadline coming up tomorrow, in which case please focus on your duties.
