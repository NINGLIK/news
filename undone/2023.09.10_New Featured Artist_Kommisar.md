# New Featured Artist: Kommisar

作者：**pishifat**

**Kommisar**'s chiptune creations bring more than just nostalgia to our Featured Artist library!

**Kommisar** has been around on osu! for a *long time*, both as [an osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/773405) and a musician. Their first song to make an impact on osu! was [this classic April Fools' joke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28222) from 2011, followed by the infamous stream map [Chipstream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/104784) half a decade later. Earlier today, **Kommisar** made an unexpected return to osu! through an [osu! original](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu!_originals) in [this year's MWC 4K](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/MWC/2023_4K)!

**10** tunes produced almost entirely with a Game Boy music sequencer are here to stay. Check 'em out from [**Kommisar**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/379)!

It's been over a month since [COE](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023) ended, but this video of [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078) playing [Chipstream](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/104784) may make you think otherwise:
