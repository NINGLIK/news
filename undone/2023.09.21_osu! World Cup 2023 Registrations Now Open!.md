## How do I register?

**[Click here!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/41)**

Please note that teams will be formed by each country's captain *after* the registration phase has concluded. **The deadline for registering is October 5, 23:59 UTC. Make sure to submit yours before then!**

*Notice: you may only participate if your position in the osu! global ranking is #5,000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules) in the past 12 months.*

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of time to avoid any last-minute headaches. If you run into any issues, send an email to [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh).*
