# New Featured Artist: Will Stetson

by：**pishifat**

Yep.

**Will Stetson** is a one-of-a-kind [osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4909088). While he was grinding thousands of hours clicking circles, winning tournaments, and commentating for our very own [osu! World Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/OWC), he's also been pursuing a career as a vocalist!

For the better half of a decade, **Will Stetson** has been pumping out covers of iconic songs in the osu! community. (A certain *"me no mae no"* may ring a bell.) As of 2023, he's begun producing his own original tracks, and that's why he's here today!

We've picked up all **4** of **Will Stetson**'s original tracks, each of which is available *now* from [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/385)!

Sticking to his roots as an osu! player, **Will Stetson**'s debut as a Featured Artist came alongside a map of his track *Koala* being showcased in [this year's OWC Round of 32 mappool](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/OWC/2023)! Check it out for yourself:

------

[**Will Stetson**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/385) has pre-timed beatmap templates for every song above. If you ever felt the urge to support an osu! player's pursuit towards their dreams, mapping one of these songs is the best way you can do it.

And that's all for now! One more Featured Artist is planned for the month, so keep your eyes (and ears) peeled for that next weekend!

Stay tuned.
