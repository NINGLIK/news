# Halloween 2023 Descends

by：**Ephemeral**

By the ineffable will of the Dean "peppy" Herbert, we are having Halloween right this very moment — so come check out the winners from the Halloween 2023 Fanart Contest, soon to be featured in a game client near you!

We've known this for a while, but we think you guys might have a bit of a thing for spooky month (and also possibly witches). Over **178** entries went up for a harrowing round of voting across almost a week, and the osu! community leapt so hard into the voting that we almost thought things were broken for a second or two.

But with only **20** votes each to go around, the bulk of us truly felt the greatest fear Halloween truly has to offer: too many damn good choices, and not enough votes to spend for them all. It's like having an entire candy basket full of every particular treat you like — where do you even start?!

Somehow, you managed, and we now have our latest Halloween 2023 seasonal backgrounds for all to behold. But enough waffling, it's time to check out the winners:

## Finalists

**2420** voters fell prey to the enchanting charms of contest veteran [**mocapixel**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11596939)'s witch pippi! It was clear from the opening hours of the contest that this piece was going to hold a lead — and *hold it did*, with hundreds of votes practically the entire time. A stunning combination of colour work and magical magnificence really captures that quintessential Halloween feeling, all while remaining easy to look at.

Speaking of charms, the 4th time turned out to be it for mocapixel, who earns their first top-voted finalist place with flying colours! Quite literally, in this case, because you know, witches, brooms, so on... ahem. Congratulations!

[**P4ndemonium**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6639059)'s devilish pippi tricked **2152** voters into yielding their precious stars! Complete with holographic graffiti sporting mode motifs and more, this bewinged mascot was clearly going places: specifically straight to second. Could this be the beginning of a new Project Loved costume for our most beloved mascot? Because that sure is a lot of hearts she's stolen...

Pastel prowess presides in [**tehfire**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7082924)'s profoundly perfect painting, earning adulation from **1982** voters. Everything about this entry is simply wonderful, from the costume designs featuring the Fabulous Five (specifically pippi, Mocha, Chirou, Yuzu and the Taikonator) to simply stunning painterly brushwork and palette choices reminiscent of ethereal candy. Rumour has it that if one looks hard enough, they can perhaps see two, no... *three* stragglers sequestered somewhere special.

We expect this one will end up on a lot of people's desktops!

[**Khize**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12736392) summoned the coven of mascots and **1955** voters joined in the call, bringing forth a witchy welcome for pippi (who also brought along a don familiar), Mocha and Chirou! It's surprising how well the osu!taiko logo works as a magic robe decal. We'll have to drum up some thought for that one.

**1791** voters applauded the lady of the castle at [**ZunK**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1070783)'s behest, who conjured a particularly impish pippi toting a monocle in a fancy gothic-inspired Halloween dress. Can she keep getting away with raising the candy taxes? With a look like that, the answer is yes, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

[![img](https://i.ppy.sh/4b8eedd1ae4af0ab73199a6fb24bf4423d7b90e4/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e7070792e73682f636f6e74657374732f3138362f62616e6e6572732f53636973736f72735f4d6f72692e6a7067)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/186/winners/Scissors_Mori.png)

**1750** ghostly spirits asked which witch is which, and the answer was [**Scissors_Mori**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/31302044)'s take on our beloved pink-fringed pippi! Witches really are vogue this year, but with costumes *this* cute, it's sort of inevitable, isn't it?

[![img](https://i.ppy.sh/9a44e6112afecdc12360b588d331fc5071248e9b/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e7070792e73682f636f6e74657374732f3138362f62616e6e6572732f315f7a65726f2e6a7067)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/186/winners/1_zero.png)

Behold! **1547** voter bats circled the spooky manor depicted by [**1 zero**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7440794), where a witch pippi and an animal girl jiangshi Mocha prowl looking for delicious candy treats! A terrifying ghostly feline stands guard with his broom, ready to sweep spirits and scores both.

[**Amplui**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24820805) wowed **1545** voters with their vivaciously vibrant and nefariously neon demon pippi! Eating an entire box of highlighter pens has never seemed so attractive until now! We're all but certain this one is really going to draw eyes in-game — a real eye-catcher for sure!

[![img](https://i.ppy.sh/c5d312af1e7c82a723bbc6bc7c047c879782e1f3/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e7070792e73682f636f6e74657374732f3138362f62616e6e6572732f53757065725353756e2e6a7067)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/186/winners/SuperSSun.png)

**1437** voters supported [**SuperSSun**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6972778)'s stupendous sketch, showcasing several spooky mascots in all of their artbook glory! It's wonderful to see artists continually playing with new styles and approaches like this, and we're looking forward to seeing what both this artist and many more to come make with their incredible creativity!

[![img](https://i.ppy.sh/3a8ddb2c8ebfe89b21a14c2a043478e50969eb1a/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e7070792e73682f636f6e74657374732f3138362f62616e6e6572732f4d696e4d696e5f39732e6a7067)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/186/winners/MinMin_9s.png)

**1375** voters were wowed by [**MinMin_9s**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7140649)'s beautifully simplistic take on a cutesy witch pippi accompanied by her bed sheet ghost retinue of Mocha and Aiko. The pigtails sticking out of the sheet is simply genius. Why didn't we think of that?!

[![img](https://i.ppy.sh/64f1f0599ceb14eaa62a8ac040cf15bbe8ff2cdb/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e7070792e73682f636f6e74657374732f3138362f62616e6e6572732f526564635863612e6a7067)](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/186/winners/RedcXca.png)

Fanart contest veteran [**RedcXca**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14056601) returns as a finalist once again, and can now proudly claim "I maid this", because they put Yuzu in a maid dress, and **1348** voters were astonished by how well it works. Alisa in a bunny suit is also present, as well as a guest cameo from the ever-popular Doraemon for reasons we're not even going to pretend to understand, plus several trollface skull decorations. There's more hidden in this piece to boot, but I've got too many *tasks* to do to list them.

Sure is cloudy tonight, isn't it?

**1210** voters hopped along to [**oniichan49**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20871620)'s jiangshi pippi and Aiko grooving out before a floating pumpkin audience. A witchy don is conducting this danse macabre, and we're all here for it... in spirit.

Decoration is the name of the game in [**Triantafyllia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17084594)'s piece, impressing **1122** voters. So much going on here between pippi and Mocha's incredibly ornate costumes and vibrant artistry really gunning for a beautiful collision of candy-like light and colour.

UHHHHHH BRANES. [**AyoLie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29186645) DREW ZOMBIE PIPPI. ZOMBIE MOCHA TOO. UUUURRRRRR. **1115** VOTERS LIKE VERY MUCH. BRAAAAANES. Also, a cute Chirou's chilling too. We're not entirely sure if she's a disembodied head or not, but we're going to pretend she is, because you know, Halloween. Wonderful piece!

**1079** voter ghosts are waiting patiently in line to be hugged by [**Haru34_old**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8806199)'s pippi-mummy amidst a spooky violet-tinged moonscape. Why are these spirits so unbearably cute? It is a mystery.

## peppy's Picks

Long ago before time was counted, the Dean "peppy" Herbert once uttered deep within the hallowed crypts (of our internal Discord server) that there were too many good entries and not enough votes to go around. For thousands of years (approximately eleven seconds, we counted) did he contemplate, before deciding to invoke his coveted power of *The Pick*, and select his favourite entries to join our finalists on the main menu anyway. We've since discovered that if you gave him triple the number of ordinary votes, he'd still run out of them somehow.

Thus, the Picks were born. And now, we all benefit.

[**Christi_Anna**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11016739) gathered forth an assembly of mascots most stylish, including pippi, Chirou, Yuzu, the warring twins (Mani and Mari) plus Mocha and a don to enjoy some candlelit Halloween festivities. Look at the cat!

[**Amythenia**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19931859)'s witch pippi blazes along the latest experimental osu!mania key mode, which is so long that it quite literally comes from the moon. We did the math, and it'd be about *28 billion keys*, assuming the average width of a piano key. That's a lot of keys, almost enough to match the amount of cute going on in this piece. There's a pumpkin don too!

[**sleepysheeps**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10868930) very much woke the Dean "peppy" Herbert up with this adorable chibi-fied wolfgirl pippi and warlock Yuzu roaming the Hallow's Eve streets in search of delicious candy.

[**The Seraph**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/30000000) plays a dangerous game with pippi, Mocha, Mari and Chirou all engaged in spooky ouija board readings. Mocha is being a bit of a wuss, but when the board spelled out "HARUMAC—" only moments ago, can you really blame her?

*Fun extra fact: The Seraph is our 30 millionth user! You don't see that every day!*
