不,你的眼睛没有欺骗你.

And no, your eyes are not deceiving you.

在如此早期的比赛中,老将之间的冲突是由于加拿大在 [TwitchCon 参加预选赛时的特殊情况](https://twitter.com/xootynator/status/1716179172270166224)而发生的,导致了不寻常的第 11 号种子位置.观众们期待的赔率与抛硬币一样好,而 [osu!世界杯选拔赛](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/130)的得票率几乎[持平](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/images/shared/news/2023-11-08-osu-world-cup-2023-round-of-16-recap/pickem.png).北美队以3-1领先,包括对[Mysteka - Jerrybeans](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1860553#osu/3825151)的重要破发点.德国队在低逼近率地图上迅速做出回应,[jun with Alison - SUNKiSS DROP ~jun side~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1498309#osu/3070802),拿回破发点.[Criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659) 的 SS 和 [Shiox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11921197) 的 1x100 分数提供了急需的信心.

This clash between tournament veterans at such an early stage came about due to Canada's [exceptional circumstances while playing the Qualifiers at TwitchCon](https://twitter.com/xootynator/status/1716179172270166224), resulting in an unusual 11th seed placement. The spectators were expecting odds as good as a coin flip, well represented by the [osu! World Cup pick'ems](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/130) getting [nearly even votes](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/images/shared/news/2023-11-08-osu-world-cup-2023-round-of-16-recap/pickem.png). The North American squad had the better start going up 3–1 including an important break point on [Mysteka - Jerrybeans](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1860553#osu/3825151). Germany responded quickly on the low-approach-rate map [jun with Alison - SUNKiSS DROP ~jun side~](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1498309#osu/3070802), claiming the break point right back. [Criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659)'s SS and [Shiox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11921197)'s 1x100 score provided much needed confidence.

然而,在竞争激烈的 [Yamamoto Mineko - Presea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2082024#osu/4360325) 选秀权上,破发点的蛞蝓盛宴仍在继续.最终,这对加拿大来说至关重要,他们将第一个赛点转化为种子爆冷5-2战胜2022年铜牌得主.

However, the slug fest of break points continued on a highly contested [Yamamoto Mineko - Presea](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2082024#osu/4360325) pick. Eventually, this turned out to be the crucial point for Canada, and they converted their first match point into the seed upset 5–2 victory against the bronze medallist of 2022.

###  泰国 vs. 新西兰

泰国队在32强赛中被美国队横扫,而新西兰队则在对阵意大利的胜者组比赛中勉强晋级.因此,新西兰人的信心水平似乎相当高,而且赔率对他们有利.

The team from Thailand were swept against the United States back in the Round of 32, while New Zealand just barely missed out on advancing in the winners' bracket against Italy. Thus, the confidence level from the Kiwis seemed quite high, and the odds were in their favour.

碰巧的是,泰国在每张地图上以不到 30k 分的优势赢得了自己的前两个选秀权.然而,新西兰队在自信地赢得自己的选择的同时,没有赢得一个破发点,这导致了决胜局.在这里,泰国遭遇了灾难,因为 [Deppyforce](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5286213) 在上一张地图中断开连接,并且无法再重新启动.新西兰重新领先并扩大了领先优势——直到 Deppyforce 复活,并与 [chests](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14806365) 和 [Zoomer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6600930) 一起打出了全连击.

As it happens, Thailand struggled quite a bit to win their own first two picks by a margin of less than 30k points on each map. However, New Zealand didn't manage to win a single break point while confidently winning their own picks, which consequently led to the tiebreaker. Here, disaster struck for Thailand as [Deppyforce](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5286213) disconnected during the last map and a restart was not possible anymore. New Zealand took the lead back and increased it — until Deppyforce resurrected and proceeded to full combo the tiebreaker along with [chests](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14806365) and [Zoomer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6600930).

再加上 [Lesperry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18092331) 在整场比赛中为团队带来的巨大贡献,新西兰人在两次令人心碎的决胜局失利后被淘汰出局,而泰国队的阵容将继续他们在四分之一决赛中的旅程,接下来面对乌克兰.

That combined with [Lesperry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18092331)'s otherwise huge carry for the team throughout the match, the Kiwis have been eliminated after two heartbreaking tiebreaker losses whereas Thailand's roster will continue their journey in the Quarterfinals to face Ukraine next.

###  哈萨克斯坦 vs. 日本

哈萨克斯坦有资格参加 osu!世界杯自比赛开始以来的第一次,这对普通观众来说是一个惊喜.作为种子#32,每一分都感觉像是一场小小的胜利.这个围绕 [Kamensh1k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16817965) 的名单表明一切皆有可能,尤其是在前几轮.

Kazakhstan qualified for the osu! World Cup for the first time since the inception of the tournament, which was a surprise to the average viewer. As seed #32, every point feels like a small victory. This roster orbiting around [Kamensh1k](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16817965) showed that everything is possible, especially in early rounds.

他们在 [Motley Croe - Kickstart My Heart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1332159#osu/2760226) 上迈出了对阵日本的第一步,以不到 **10,000** 分的差距夺得了地图胜利.日本队迅速以两分回应,日本队迅速回敬了两个赛点,其中包括一个令人信服的破发点([sHimaU - Noumen Break](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1964101#osu/4319264)).然后,来自中亚的队伍突然连赢三张地图,将他们带到了4-2,双赛点.日本队迫切需要自己以3-0的比分留在比赛中.头号选手 [Teacchyyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7178423) 在最需要的时候出现,在 [Toromaru - Ebb Tide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2082040#osu/4360358) 和得分最高的 [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1594769#osu/3257371)上只错过了一次,让日本队在比赛中迫使决胜局.

They took the first step against Japan on [Motley Croe - Kickstart My Heart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1332159#osu/2760226), clutching the map victory by a difference of less than **10,000** points. The Japanese team swiftly replied with two points including a convincing break point on [sHimaU - Noumen Break](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1964101#osu/4319264). Then, out of nowhere, the team from Central Asia won three consecutive maps, bringing them to 4–2, double match point. Japan desperately needed their own 3–0 run to stay in the tournament. Top player [Teacchyyy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7178423) was there when most needed, missing just once on [Toromaru - Ebb Tide](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2082040#osu/4360358) and top-scoring [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1594769#osu/3257371), keeping Japan in the match to force the tiebreaker.

在这一点上,这是经验的差距.[rollpan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998) 凭借钢铁般的意志,以一记干净利落的 FC,将太阳升起的国度带入了四分之一决赛.哈萨克斯坦的表现真是太棒了,他几乎让奇迹发生了.

At this point, it was a difference of experience. [rollpan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3062998) with nerves of steel landed a clean FC to advance the land of the rising sun to the Quarterfinals. What an amazing performance by Kazakhstan who almost made the miracle happen.
