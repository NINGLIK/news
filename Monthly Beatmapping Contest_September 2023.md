# Monthly Beatmapping Contest: September 2023

作者：**pishifat, RandomeLoL**

This classic contest makes a comeback yet again! See if you have what it takes to take home the gold and make your way towards the coveted Elite Mapper title.

Let's be honest: the [Monthly Beatmapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest) (*MBC*) isn't anything special — but that may be what makes it so valuable.

This is a plain 'n' simple mapping contest, allowing mappers to show off their talents! (...and earn some [prizes](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023#rewards) along the way.)

Let's break it down:

## Game modes

This month's contest is open to **osu!** and **osu!mania** mappers.

## Beatmapping

### Limitation

Creating a quality beatmap is a solid goal, but true creativity comes when your tools are restricted.

That's why we're adding **limitations** to this contest!

#### osu! limitation

This month's osu! limitation: **all sliders must be curved.**

More specifically, *every segment of a slider must be curved*. Here's some visual examples to clear things up:

<img src="https://i.ppy.sh/6102b4d7b836ff17f66b20bb7b35ad75401f8da5/68747470733a2f2f6f73752e7070792e73682f77696b692f696d616765732f7368617265642f6e6577732f323032332d30392d30342d6d6f6e74686c792d626561746d617070696e672d636f6e746573742d73657074656d6265722d323032332f6c696d69746578616d706c652e706e67">

Part of the judging criteria involves how you handle the limitation, so keep that in mind if you're creating [sliders that are *technically curved* yet look exactly like straight sliders](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/images/shared/news/2023-09-04-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023/technicality.png).

#### osu!mania limitation

osu!mania's contest hosts opted for a more song-focused limitation: **your beatmap's [drain time](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Drain_time) must be at least \*4 minutes\*!**

Your biggest struggle might be finding a song packed with enough variation to make a cool beatmap. Luckily, there's *a lot* of songs to choose from:

### Songs

#### osu!

Any song listed on [osu!'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) is eligible for this contest!

Feel free to cut longer songs to a length that's easier to map. [Talk to pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418) if you need help with that!

#### osu!mania

Due to [osu!mania's limitation](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-09-monthly-beatmapping-contest-september-2023#osu!mania-limitation) this month, any [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) song that is at least 4 minutes is eligible for this contest! [This search filter](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/tracks?is_default_sort=true&sort=update_desc&length[gte]=240) includes every song that's 4 minutes or longer, so your song must be in this list!

## Rewards

The Monthly Beatmapping Contest rewards users with [contest points](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Contests/Contest_points) based on their placements:

- **Winner:** 2 points
- **Runner-up:** 1 point

Additionally, a **Mappers' Guild keychain** is optionally rewarded to the winner of each month's contest. Its design is based on your beatmap!

![keychain](https://i.ppy.sh/36d768e562baf4bff801cf05dc1032d18c53f83e/68747470733a2f2f6f73752e7070792e73682f77696b692f696d616765732f7368617265642f6e6577732f323032332d30382d32392d6368616e6765732d746f2d7468652d6d6170706572732d6775696c642f6b6579636861696e2e6a7067)
