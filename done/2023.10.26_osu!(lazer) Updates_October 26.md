# osu!(lazer) Updates: October 26

by：**Walavouchey**

Another day, another batch of updates sent your way.

Today's update contains mostly improvements to game mechanics and quality-of-life changes:

### Changes

- **Beat snap grid for the osu!taiko editor.** Now all game modes have snap grids!
- **"Adjust pitch" toggle for Double Time and Half Time mods.** Allowing the pitch to adjust prevents sound distortions (and also probably just sounds cool to some of you).
- **More lenient slider ends for fast sliders.** On very fast sliders, you now only need to be tracking somewhere in the last 36 ms, rather than at the point 36 ms before the slider end.
- **Removed osu!mania hold note ticks.** If you release a hold note before the end, you'll immediately miss. Hold notes now give combo *solely* for the start and end. That means two (2) combo per hold note.
- **osu!mania PERFECT judgements changed to only award bonus score.** They're no longer required for 100% accuracy. Each PERFECT judgement directly gives 10 points, on top of the 1,000,000 score cap.
- **Player invites for multiplayer rooms.** Right-click someone's user panel and send them your cordial invitation to a match of fun and glory. More ways to invite people will be added in the future.
- **Maximum bonus judgement counts shown in the results screen.** If you SS a map and it has a spinner, you'll know how many spins you'll need for perfection. If you're using the "argon" or the "triangles" skin, it'll also show "MAX" when you've spun the maximum amount.

There is a [full changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer/2023.1026.0) which details even more changes, but it's mostly minor bug fixes and consistency changes.

Some of these changes may be hard to fully grasp from one or two sentences, but [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) does an excellent job explaining them in the video above.
