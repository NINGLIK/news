# New Featured Artist: beignet

by：**pishifat**

[YUC'e](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/372) and [Aice room / Nor](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/360) return to expand our Featured Artist library under the joint alias **beignet**!

When these two collaborated for the first time in 2017, they had so much fun that they immediately knew they'd need to do it again and again and again. That's when **beignet** officially formed, and today, **beignet** officially has become one of osu!'s Featured Artists.

**8** joint journeys can be found on [**beignet**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/377), each showcasing different sides of each artist's styles (and conveniently available in pre-timed beatmap templates).

Everyone plays osu! in their own distinct way. While at [COE](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023), we asked [Dwagon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9975427), who plays with a full-alternating style, to try out [beignet - Sign](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2030991). Check that out along with all of these other maps:
