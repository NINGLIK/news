# New Featured Artist: Kou!

by：**pishifat**

osu!'s Featured Artist catalogue has been missing one thing until now: **Kou!**

Composing with a self-proclaimed "undefined" style, **Kou!**'s works combine more genres and subgenres than any sane person can reasonably identify — high-speed dubstep, J-core, hitech, chiptune, oriental, uptempo, hardcore, speedcore... we'll stop the list there.

These songs are unlike anything you've heard before, and **6** of them are up for grabs from [**Kou!**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383)!

Need a sample of **Kou!**'s musical dexterity? (Hint: the correct answer is *yes*.) Take a peek at [Accolibed](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9269034) as he tries an 8-star map live at [COE](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/cavoe's_osu!_event/2023)!

You're looking for *something*. Perhaps that *something* can be found on [**Kou!**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/383) in the form of a beatmap template. If that *something* isn't there, look harder. It's there.

## Featured Artist playlists

[**C-Show**'s Featured Artist announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-02-new-featured-artist-c-show#featured-artist-playlists) debuted a new batch of [**Featured Artist playlists** in osu!(lazer)](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists).

Playlist leaders earn prizes based on [this cumulative leaderboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/Featured_Artists/Featured_Artist_playlists#cumulative-leaderboard). Anyone with **10 total points** earns a profile badge for their respective mode:
