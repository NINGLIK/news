# New Featured Artist: Solarbear

作者：**pishifat**

"Map of the stars" has a completely new meaning with **Solarbear**'s addition to our Featured Artist library!

Mishmashing classic Game Boy samples with genre elements ranging from electro house to metal alongside a ton of variable time signatures, **Solarbear** shows just how exotic chiptune music can be.

**5** tracks shined enough to make their way to [**Solarbear**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/388). Pick them up while they're hot (which should be a few million years, give or take).

The osu!mania community was the first to take a liking to **Solarbear**'s complicated, multi-layered style, so it's only appropriate to showcase **Solarbear**'s sound through the genre-blending masterpiece [Stick Your Ins Out](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1149112)! Check that (and the rest of these previews) out:
